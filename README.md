# MCEmu
Run emulators in Minecraft!
## Installation
First, you need forge. (Just google "Minecraft Forge")

Then you need to put the .jar into your mods folder. After opening the game with the mod installed once, you will see a new folder in your minecraft folder called "roms". Go into "roms" and put your NES roms into the "nes" folder. After you restart the game, you will see the roms as cartridges in the "MCEmu: NES" creative category.
